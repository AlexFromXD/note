# Firecracker

# Execution Environment

ÊØèÂÄã Execution Environment ÈÉΩÊòØ‰∏ÄÂÄãÁç®Á´ãÁöÑ Firecracker VM

> This execution environment manages the processes and resources that are needed to run your function. When a function is first invoked, Lambda creates a new execution environment for the function to run in. After the function has finished running, Lambda doesn't stop the execution environment right away; if the function is invoked again, Lambda can re-use the existing execution environment (**Warm start**). ref ‚Üí https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/concepts-basics.html#gettingstarted-concepts-runtime

## Lifecycle

- Init
- Restore (SnapStart only)
- Invoke
- Shutdown

![lifecycle.png](lifecycle.png)

### Init Phase

1. Start all extensions (`Extension init`)
2. Bootstrap the runtime (`Runtime init`)
3. Run the function's static code (`Function init`)

   1. Outside of the main handler. such as import libraries and dependencies, set up configurations, and initialize connections to other services.
   2. The initialization code is not run again if an invocation uses a warm execution environment.

   ‚ö†Ô∏è The largest contributor of latency before function execution comes from initialization code.

4. Run any before-checkpoint¬†[runtime hooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart-runtime-hooks.html)¬†(Lambda SnapStart only)

#### Limitation

- The¬†`Init`¬†phase is limited to 10 seconds.¬† (except for `SnapStart` or `Provisioned Concurrency`)
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtime-environment.html#static-initialization
- If the¬†`Init`¬†phase is successful, Lambda doesn't emit the¬†`INIT_REPORT`¬†log unless¬†[SnapStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html)¬†or¬†[provisioned concurrency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/provisioned-concurrency.html)¬†is enabled.

### Invoke Phase

> When a Lambda function is invoked in response to a¬†`Next`¬†API request, Lambda sends an¬†`Invoke`¬†event to the runtime and to each extension.

### Shutdown Phase

**Duration limit**: The maximum duration of the¬†`Shutdown`¬†phase depends on the configuration of registered extensions:

- 0 ms ‚Äì A function with no registered extensions
- 500 ms ‚Äì A function with a registered internal extension
- 2,000 ms ‚Äì A function with one or more registered external extensions

If the runtime or an extension does not respond to the¬†`Shutdown`¬†event within the limit, Lambda ends the process using a¬†`SIGKILL`¬†signal.

### Provisioned Concurrency

- The number of `pre-initialized execution environments` allocated to your function.
- keeps functions initialized and ready to respond in `double-digit milliseconds.`
- Use provisioned concurrency if your application has strict cold start latency requirements that can't be adequately addressed by SnapStart.
